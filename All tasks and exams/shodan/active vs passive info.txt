To break in to a sysem for penetration testion we need to know entry points and any vulnerabilities in these entry points.
Ths is done through info gathering.

Two main steps :   
                    passive information gathering
                    active information gathering

passive:
        info gathering done publicly available resources( Open source intelligence, OSINT) such as search engines,google hacking.
        no direct interaction with the target.
        no requests sent to target => target ignores info is being gathered about them.
        info such as Ip addresses, domain names,email addresses, names,hostnames,dns records,software running on a website,
        etc can be gathered through this method.
 

Passive info gathering tools:

    ***google hacking database => to access hidden files, metadata,usernames,passwords,etc
   
    ***netcraft => finds info related to domains network, ssl/tls, hosting history, owner, domain registrar,etc
    
    ***shodan=> identifies IOT devices and network devices over the internet.Gives info about potential vulnerabilities,
    ISP,hostnames,open ports, SSL, encryption algos,etc


active:
       without authorization and be illegal. Can be done by actively interacting with the target, port scanning,
       OS fingerprinting.
       relies on tools which will send different requests to the computer sysem to gather system specific info about the target.
       gathers info about the device or other devices connected to it on the same network.
       info like open/closed ports, OS of a machine, services that are running,finding vulnerabilities in apps, etc

       Disadvantage of active info gathering:  direct internet with host has a chance of trigerring the system's IDS/IPS and
       alerting people to your activity.


active info gathering tools:
                nmap: network mapper and port scanner

                nessus: commercial vulnerability scanner.

                nikito: identifies vulnerabilitieson web servers
