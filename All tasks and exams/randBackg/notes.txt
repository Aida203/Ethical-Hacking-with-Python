
HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) Methods:
        GET =>to request data from a specific source
        POST=>send data to a server to create or update a resurce

Unlike get,post can not be cached,data not displayed on url, safer  and parameters don't remain in the browser history

        PUT=> send data to a server to createupdate a resource

        HEAD=>like get but without the response body( a list of users is returned with get method)

        DELETE =>deletes a specifies source
        PATCH=>apply partial modifications to a resource
        OPTIONS=>describes communication options for the target resource
        CONNECT=>start two-way communications/a tunnel with requested resource
        TRACE=>performs message loop-back tests to test the path for the specified resource. Good for debugging.       

        
API(Application Programming Interface)
        A code which controls a server's access point(s)
Give users tthe ability to make an API call or request for info.
It's like the menu of a restaurant with the list of all dishes together with their description.

         An api is a list of a group of operations used by developers for their apps without necessarily knowing the history and complexity behind their functionalities.



JSON(javascript object notation):
         a way of representing data which looks like js objects
         I an API returns json then this can be accesed by java,python, ruby,php,js,etc
=> API's are highly scalable an platform independent.
