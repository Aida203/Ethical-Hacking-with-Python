Used to define layouts for webpages. We do that using tags which tells how we want our browser 
to look and what content we wish for it to have

                   
                Standard tags all html should have:

1)Definning what the document type of the file will be =><!DOCTYPE html>

2)Container tags to hold content and other html tags <html>  </html>
The document is made up of two sections: the head and body

3)The head=> <head>...</head> defines data about the document e0g title, description, attributes about the document
like images, to import resources we need in the html files (css, js, etc)
=> the head is like metadata (info about data) about the actual file

4)The body => <body> </body> will have all our html content. Everythying in the body will be rendered/shown in the web browser

Parent tag => html container tag

Child tag => head and body are child tags to the parent

sibling tags => head and body are siblings

5)Title tag <title> .... </title> => to hold text and willl be the title of the website => tab name

Other tags 
A) FOUND IN THE HEAD

1) Meta tag=> defines info about our file => metadata. e.g defining the character set type of our web page, meta description tag to give a description to our website 

When you search something on google and the webpages have a little description about them => meta description tag

<meta charset=......>
<meta name="....." content="......">

charset, name, content are attributes of the meta tag
for the second one we are give our meta tag a name and stating what it will contain

B) FOUND IN THE BODY 
1-Heading tag=> <h1> </h1> , we have till h6 and h1 is the largest with h6 being the smallest.
    Use them to anounce/ lable/ give a title to a section of a document

2-Paragraph => <p> .......</p> Text here goes in it's own paragraph. As much text as desired can be put here. Generally a block of text.

To style the paragraphs e.g bold =>  <p>I'm <b><another/b> paragraph</p> will display with "another" being bold
bold => <b></b>
italics => <i> </i>
 both => <b> <i>  .....  </i> </b>

THE LAYOUT OF OUR DOCUMENT:   The order in the document => order found in browser

To create WHITE SPACE =>  <br/> and we can use as many as needed

Straight LINE => <hr/> and it goes all the way along the page

To increase the TEXT SIZE => use big ( <big> </big>) and small tags  (  <small> </small>)

SUBSCRIPTS and SUPER SCRIPTS => subs=>  <sub>....</sub>
                                super=> <sup>...</sup>

COMMENTS =>  <!-- blblablala is invisible -->

STYLING =>            <p  style="color: blue"  >Welcome to some html practice</p>
           <p  style="background-color: aqua;"  >Welcome to some html practice</p>
